### Hi there üëã


<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=h1ghbre4k3r">

I'm Louis, a CS student from Northern Germany with an affinity for IoT, distributed systems, mobile and web development. I am the creator of [MoneyBoy](https://github.com/pesca-dev/moneyboy-app), an app for managing and tracking payments between friends, and [Dependory](https://github.com/H1ghBre4k3r/dependory), a featherweight dependency injection framework for TypeScript.
