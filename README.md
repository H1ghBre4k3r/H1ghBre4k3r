### Hi there üëã


<img align="right" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=h1ghbre4k3r">

#### üå± My latest projects

- [H1ghBre4k3r/aoc-2023](https://github.com/H1ghBre4k3r/aoc-2023) - Yes. These are my solutions for AoC 2023. No guarantee for completeness or correctness. Maybe I will include some proofs. But mostly some random tests based on the example data. We will see. However, I&#39;m really looking forward for solving each problem! Probably I will just &#34;leave&#34; after day 6 or 7 (like last year), we&#39;ll see. Nonetheless, have fun!
